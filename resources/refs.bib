	abstract = {Biological invasions represent a threat to ecosystems, through competition and habitat destruction, which may result in significant changes of the invaded community. Asparagopsis armata Harvey 1855 is a red macroalgae (Rodophyta) globally recognized as an invasive species. It is found from the intertidal to shallow subtidal areas, on rock or epiphytic, forming natural vegetation belts on exposed coasts. This study evaluated the variations on native intertidal seaweed and macroinvertebrate assemblages inhabiting rock pools with and without the presence of the invasive macroalgae A. armata. To achieve this, manipulation experiments on Atlantic (Portugal) rock pools were done. Three rock pools were maintained without A. armata by manual removal of macroalgae, and three others were not experimentally manipulated during the study period and A. armata was freely present. In this study the variations between different rock pools were assessed. Results showed different patterns in the macroalgae composition of assemblages but not for the macrobenthic communities. Ellisolandia elongata (J. Ellis \& Solander) K.R. Hind \& G.W. Saunders 2013 was the main algal species affected by the invasion of A. armata. Invaded pools tended to show less macroalgal species richness, showing a more constant and conservative structure, with lower variation of its taxonomic composition than the pools not containing A. armata, where the variability between samples was always higher. Despite the importance of the achieved results, further data based on observation of long-term series are needed, in order to further understand more severe effects of the invader A. armata on native macroalgal assemblage.},

	abstract = {The integrated aquaculture of the tetrasporophyte of Asparagopsis armata Harvey (Falkenbergia rufolanosa) using fish farm effluents may be viable due to the species high capacity of removing nutrients and its content of halogenated organic compounds with applications on the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. In order to optimize the integrated aquaculture of F. rufolanosa, we followed the daily variation of the potential quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of PSII on plants cultivated at different biomass densities and different total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) fluxes to check if they are photoinhibited at any time of the day. Moreover, the photoinhibition under continuous exposure to highly saturating irradiance and its potential for subsequent recovery in the shade was assessed. The potential for year round cultivation was evaluated by measuring rates of O2 evolution of plants acclimated at temperatures ranging from 15 to 29 °C, the temperature range of a fish farm effluent in southern Portugal where an integrated aquaculture system of F. rufolanosa was constructed. Photoinhibition does not seem to be a major constrain for the integrated aquaculture of F. rufolanosa. Only when cultivated at a very low density of 1.5 g fresh weight (FW) l−1 that there was a midday decrease in maximal quantum yield (Fv/Fm). At densities higher than 4 g FW l−1, no photoinhibition was observed. When exposed to full solar irradiance for 1 h, F. rufolanosa showed a 33\% decrease in Fv/Fm, recovering to 86\% of the initial value after 2 h in the shade. A midday decline of the F. rufolanosa Fv/Fm was also observed under the lowest TAN flux tested (∼6 μM h−1), suggesting that this fast and easy measurement of fluorescence may be used as a convenient diagnostic tool to detect nutrient-starved unbalance conditions of the cultures. Maximum net photosynthesis peaked at 15 °C with 9.7 mg O2 g dry weight (DW)−1 h−1 and remained high until 24 °C. At 29 °C, the net oxygen production was significantly reduced due to a dramatic increase of respiration, suggesting this to be the species' lethal temperature threshold. Results indicate that F. rufolanosa has a considerable photosynthetic plasticity and confirm it as a good candidate for integrated aquaculture at temperatures up to 24° C and cultivation densities of at least 5 g FW l−1. When cultivated at these densities, light does not penetrate below the first few centimetres of the surface zone. Plants circulate within the tanks, spending around 10\% of the time in the first few centimetres where they are able to use efficiently the saturating light levels without damaging their photosynthetic apparatus.},

	abstract = {The kelp, Ecklonia radiata, dominates the sublittoral zone within the Doubtful Sound complex. Doubtful Sound is one of a series of fourteen fiords indenting the southwestern coast of the South Island, New Zealand. A feature of these fiords is the freshwater layer that resides atop the salt water, creating a unique marine environment. Mature sporophytes were collected from three sites (two outer sites towards the coastline and one site within the fiord) over a fourteen-month period (October 1998 to December 1999). Growth rates, measured using the hole punch technique, were greatest in spring at all three sites. The nutrient eco-physiology of mature E. radiata was investigated by measuring inorganic nitrogen (NO−3 and NH+4) uptake rates at eight concentrations (2–64 μM). Soluble tissue nitrogen (NO−3 and NH+4) and tissue carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios were also determined. At all sites, E. radiata showed higher uptake rates for ammonium than for nitrate. In winter, soluble tissue nitrogen was lower at the two outer sites compared to the inner site, while in summer, levels at all sites were similar but had decreased from the winter values. C:N ratios greater than 20 were observed at all sites, increasing in summer to a peak in autumn, suggesting E. radiata may be nitrogen limited, particularly in late summer. Environmental parameters (photon flux density, water temperature, rainfall and wind) were measured, as was sea water velocity around the primary blade of E. radiata, and multivariate correlations used to determine which (if any) environmental parameter exerted greatest influence on eco-physiological parameters accessed.},

	abstract = {With increasing interest in feed-based methane mitigation strategies and regional legal directives aimed at methane production from the agricultural sector, identifying local sources of biological feed additives will be critical for rendering these strategies affordable. In a recent study, the red alga \textit{Asparagopsis taxiformis} harvested offshore Australia was identified as highly effective for reducing methane production from enteric fermentation. Due to potential difference in methane-reduction potential and the financial burden associated with transporting the harvested seaweed over long distances, we examined locally sourced red seaweed \textit{A. taxiformis} and brown seaweed \textit{Zonaria farlowii} for their ability to mitigate methane production when added to feed widely used in the Californian dairy industry. At a dose rate of 5\% dry matter (DM), California-sourced \textit{A. taxiformis} and \textit{Z. farlowii} reduced methane production by up to 74\% (p {\textless}= 0.05) and 11\% (p {\textless}= 0.05) during \textit{in vitro} rumen fermentation, respectively. No effect on CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ production was observed for either seaweed. The measured decrease in methane production induced by \textit{A. taxiformis} and \textit{Z. farlowii} amendment, suggest that these local macroalgae are indeed promising candidates for biotic methane mitigation strategies in California, the largest milk producing state in the United States. To determine their real potential as methane mitigating feed supplements in the dairy industry, their effect \textit{in vivo} will need to be investigated.},

	abstract = {Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a comparatively short (9 yr) atmospheric lifetime; therefore effective strategies for methane mitigation will contribute significantly to meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goal \#13 of taking rapid action against climate change. Methane emissions from enteric fermentation constitute a large proportion of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Low inclusions of red seaweed from the genus Asparagopsis have demonstrated near elimination of enteric methane from ruminants; however, only a limited number of other seaweeds have been assessed for their anti-methanogenic potential. New Zealand red seaweed species Bonnemaisonia hamifera, Euptilota formisissima, Plocamium cirrhosum, Vidalia colensoi, and identified aquaculture target species Ecklonia radiata and Ulva sp. B were investigated as anti-methanogenic feed additives. Seaweeds were included at 0\%, 2\%, 6\%, or 10\% of feed organic matter (OM, ryegrass hay) during in vitro fermentation assays using rumen inoculant from non-lactating Friesian x Jersey dairy cows, using Asparagopsis armata as a positive control. Total gas, methane, hydrogen, volatile fatty acids, and organic matter degradation were measured over a 48 h incubation. Inclusion of all seaweeds except Ulva sp. B reduced the production of methane at either 6 or 10\% OM. Bonnemaisonia hamifera was the best performing seaweed, reducing the production of methane by 17.1\%, 95.4\%, and 98.8\% relative to the basal feed substrate control at inclusion levels of 2\%, 6\%, and 10\% OM, respectively, with notable increases in the production of hydrogen. Euptilota formisissima and P. cirrhosum reduced the production of methane by up to 50.5 and 39.5\%, respectively, at an inclusion level of 10\%, with minimal effects on measured fermentation parameters. Bromoform, the primary bioactive component in Asparagopsis, was not detected in any of the new seaweeds tested. Our results therefore identify potential alternative anti-methanogenic seaweed targets that are less susceptible to the loss of volatile bioactives during processing.},

	abstract = {The utilisation of seaweeds as feed supplements has been investigated for their potential to mitigate enteric methane emissions from ruminants. Enteric methane emissions are the primary source of direct greenhouse gas emissions in livestock and significantly contribute to anthropogenic methane emissions worldwide. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the nutritional role and the in vitro effect on cumulative gas and methane production of Asparagopsis taxiformis (native species) and Asparagopsis armata (invasive species), two species of red algae from the Azorean Sea, as well as the ability to reduce biogas production when incubated with single pasture (Lolium perenne and Trifollium repens) as substrate. Four levels of concentrations marine algae were used (1.25\%, 2.25\%, 5\%, and 10\% DM) and added to the substrate to evaluate ruminal fermentation using the in vitro gas production technique. The total amount of gas and methane produced by the treatment incubation was recorded during 72 h of incubation. The results indicate that both algae species under investigation contain relatively high levels of protein (22.69\% and 24.23\%, respectively, for Asparagopsis taxiformis and Asparagopsis armata) and significant amounts of minerals, namely magnesium (1.15\% DM), sodium (8.6\% DM), and iron (2851 ppm). Concerning in vitro ruminal fermentation, it was observed that A. taxiformis can reduce enteric methane production by approximately 86\%, during the first 24 h when 5\% is added. In the same period and at the same concentration, A. armata reduced methane production by 34\%. Thus, it can be concluded that Asparagopsis species from the Azorean Sea have high potential as a protein and mineral supplement, in addition to enabling a reduction in methane production from rumen fermentation.},

	abstract = {Species of the genus Asparagopsis are rich in halogenated bioactive compounds, particularly bromoform. Its use as a feed additive in ruminant livestock drastically decreases the animal’s methane production, thereby reducing the industry’s environmental impact. Addressing the high demand for Asparagopsis biomass requires the understanding of the culture conditions that promote higher growth rates and bromoform content. Here we evaluated how different light quality combinations (High-Blue:Red, Medium Blue:Red, High-Blue:Green:Red, and White) and four light intensities (30, 60, 90 and 120 μmol photons m−2 s−1) affect the growth and bromoform content of the Asparagopsis taxiformis tetrasporophyte in indoor tumbling cultures at two biomass densities. We also assessed the effect of light intensity on the photosynthetic response by measuring oxygen evolution rates. Light spectra containing intermediate wavelengths promoted higher growth, regardless of biomass density. Of the different light qualities tested, white light promoted the highest bromoform content. Increasing light intensity led to a positive response in A. taxiformis growth. However, the photosynthetic parameters estimated showed that the two higher light intensity treatments were above the saturation irradiance, for both culture densities. This, along with the observed development of contamination, suggests that long-term cultures of A. taxiformis should be maintained at light intensities no higher than 60 μmol photons m−2 s−1. In addition, we found that exposing cultures to higher irradiances does not guarantee a bromoform-richer biomass. These results offer valuable insights for optimizing biomass and bioactive compound production in indoor cultures of the Asparagopsis genus.},

Phycologia 45: 44–52. DOI: 10.2216/04-98.1 The kelp Ecklonia radiata is found in the sublittoral zone in the Doubtful Sound complex, and is most abundant at the coastal entrance with abundance declining toward the head of the Sound. A feature of the fjord is a persistent tannin-stained, low-salinity layer (LSL) on the surface of the underlying salt water. In this unique marine environment there is an inverse relationship between the thickness of the LSL and light levels – at the head of Doubtful Sound the LSL is thicker and light reaching E. radiata at depth can be extremely low; the inverse occurs at the coastal entrance. The mountainous terrain reduces light further, particularly on the northern aspect of the fjord. To assess whether E. radiata showed evidence of photoacclimation across this light gradient, sporophytes were collected from five sites within the complex in November 2000. Pigment contents [chlorophyll (chl) a, c and fucoxanthin], photosynthetic parameters [maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax), alpha (α), respiration rate (Rd), saturation photon-flux density (PFD) (Ek), compensation PFD (Ec) and photoinhibition (β)] and morphological parameters of E. radiata were measured. Results indicate that E. radiata acclimates to the low light at sites near the head of the fjord by increasing pigment contents, particularly chl a, as well as the surface area of the thallus. Furthermore, E. radiata increases its efficiency at capturing and transferring energy at low light by increasing α and decreasing Ek and Ec values. In doing so, E. radiata maintains similar dry weight–normalized Pmax at the five sites. It is suggested that photoacclimation may therefore be a process by which E. radiata overcomes the reduced light imposed by the LSL and extends its distribution towards the inner reaches of the fjord.},

	abstract = {The use of red seaweeds of the genus Asparagopsis as a feed ingredient drastically decreases the enteric methane production by ruminant livestock, thereby reducing the environmental impact of this industry. To address the world demand for Asparagopsis mass production, it is essential to understand the species nutrition. In this study, we evaluated for the first time the uptake kinetics of inorganic and organic nitrogen forms of the tetrasporophyte of Asparagopsis armata, to identify the different uptake phases (surge and internally controlled) and to reveal the species preferential nitrogen sources. The time course of nitrogen uptake rates was followed, and the preferential nitrogen sources were assessed in choice-uptake experiments through the incorporation of 15 N-labelled ammonium, nitrate and amino acids. As expected, the short-term, surge uptake rates were much higher than the stabilized internally controlled uptake rates. Ammonium was the preferred form during the internally controlled phase but surprisingly, the surge uptake rates of amino acids were much higher than those of inorganic forms. The importance of amino acids for A. armata nutrition was further supported by its internally controlled uptake rates that where higher than those of nitrate. Ammonium is, thus, the main nitrogen form for the species nutrition, but pulses of organic nitrogen may be considered in the mass production of Asparagopsis for the enteric methane inhibition of the livestock industry.},

	abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of growth, erosion, productivity, and morphology of the dominant habitat-forming kelp Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh were studied bimonthly over 1.5years in a southern New Zealand fjord characterized by strong gradients in light and wave exposure. Spatial differences in growth were observed with rates at two outer coast, high-light, wave-exposed sites reaching 0.42 and 0.45cm·d-1, respectively, compared to 0.27cm·d-1 at an inner, more homogeneous site. Sporophyte productivity was similar among sites, although population productivity was greater at the outer sites due to population density being 5-fold greater than at the inner site. It was expected that the inner site would have no pronounced seasonal pattern in growth and productivity due to its homogeneity; however, all three sites displayed maximum rates in late winter/spring and minimal in autumn. Growth rates were 2-fold greater during the first growth period than the following year. This discrepancy was not correlated to inorganic nitrogen (N) levels, which remained low year-round ({\textless}4μM), and is likely a result of an interaction between light and temperature, and the photosynthetic capability of E. radiata. Variable pigment content indicated photoacclimation at the inner site. Morphological differences were observed between sites, with E. radiata from the inner site having longer, wider, thinner blades and longer stipes. While E. radiata displayed spatial differences in growth, erosion, productivity, and morphology, populations displayed no temporal differences. These results highlight the need for greater understanding of the mechanisms influencing kelp growth and productivity in a unique marine environment. © 2011 Phycological Society of America.},

	abstract = {Seaweeds cultivated in traditional land-based tank systems usually grow under carbon-limited conditions and consequently have low production rates, if no costly artificial source of inorganic carbon is supplied. In integrated aquaculture, the fish effluents provide an extra source of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to seaweeds due to fish respiration. To evaluate if the tetrasporophyte of Asparagopsis armata (Harv.) F. Schmitz (the Falkenbergia stage) is carbon limited when cultivated with effluents of a fish (Sparus aurata) farm in southern Portugal, we characterized the DIC forms in the water, assessed the species photosynthetic response to the different DIC concentrations and pH values, and inferred for the presence of a carbonic anhydrase (CA)–mediated mechanism. Results showed that A. armata relies mainly on CO2 to meet photosynthetic needs. Nevertheless, from pH 7.5 upward, the CO2 supply to RUBISCO seems to derive also from the external dehydration of HCO3– mediated by CA. The contribution of this mechanism was essential for A. armata to attain fully saturated O2-evolution rates at the natural seawater DIC concentration (2–2.2 mM) and pH values (∼8.0). We revealed in this study that seaweeds cultivated in fish-farm effluents benefit not only from a rich source of ammonia but also from an important and free source of DIC for their photosynthesis. If supplied at relatively high turnover rates (∼100 vol · d−1), fish-farm effluents provide enough carbon to maximize the photosynthesis and growth even for species with low affinity for HCO3–, avoiding the artificial and costly supply of inorganic carbon to seaweed cultures.},

	abstract = {A major limiting factor in the development of algae as a feedstock for the bioenergy industry is the consistent production and supply of biomass. This study is the ﬁrst to access the suitability of the freshwater macroalgal genus Oedogonium to supply biomass for bioenergy applications. Speciﬁcally, we quantiﬁed the effect of CO2 supplementation on the rate of biomass production, carbon capture, and feedstock quality of Oedogonium when cultured in large-scale outdoor tanks. Oedogonium cultures maintained at a pH of 7.5 through the addition of CO2 resulted in biomass productivities of 8.33 ( 0.51) g DW m 2 day 1, which was 2.5 times higher than controls which had an average productivity of 3.37 ( 0.75) g DW m 2 day 1. Under these productivities, Oedogonium had a carbon content of 41–45\% and a higher heating value of 18.5 MJ kg 1, making it an ideal biomass energy feedstock. The rate of carbon ﬁxation was 1380 g C m 2 yr 1 and 1073.1 g C m 2 yr 1 for cultures maintained at a pH of 7.5 and 8.5, and 481 g C m 2 yr 1 for cultures not supplemented with CO2. This study highlights the potential of integrating the large-scale culture of freshwater macroalgae with existing carbon waste streams, for example coal-ﬁred power stations, both as a tool for carbon sequestration and as an enhanced and sustainable source of bioenergy.},

In addition, D. tenuissima and U. ohnoi are potential bioresources for the extraction of proteins (amino acids). The amino acid content of D. tenuissima (24 \% dw) was higher than that of U. ohnoi (13 \% dw). However, the annual amino acid productivity of U. ohnoi (18 t ha−1 year−1) was higher than that of D. tenuissima (14 t ha−1 year−1) due to the higher annual productivity of biomass.

Plastid (cp) DNA RFLP revealed three groups of isolates, which differed in their small subunit rRNA gene sequences, temperature responses, and tetrasporophytic morphology (cell sizes). Strains from Australia, Chile, San Diego, and Atlantic and Mediterranean Europe were identifiable as A. armata Harvey, the gametophyte of which has distinctive barbed spines. This species is believed to be endemic to cold-temperate waters of Australia and New Zealand and was introduced into Europe in the 1920s. All isolates showed identical cpDNA RFLPs, consistent with a recent introduction from Australia. Asparagopsis taxiformis (Delile) Trevisan, the type and only other recognized species, which lacks spines, is cosmopolitan in warm-temperate to tropical waters. Two clades differed morphologically and ecophysiologically and in the future could be recognized as sibling species or subspecies. A Pacific/Italian clade had 4–8° C lower survival minima and included a genetically distinct apomictic isolate from Western Australia that corresponded to the form of A. taxiformis originally described as A. sanfordiana Harvey. The second clade, from the Caribbean and the Canaries, is stenothermal (subtropical to tropical) with some ecotypic variation. The genus Asparagopsis consists of two or possibly three species, but a definitive taxonomic treatment of the two A. taxiformis clades requires study of field-collected gametophytes.},

	title = {Establishing land tank cultivation of {Asparagopsis} taxiformis in {Scotland}},
	abstract = {Asparagopsis taxiformis is a high-profile rhodophyte due to proven effects in reducing methane emissions in ruminants up to 98\%. Methane from agricultural production of ruminants is responsible for {\textasciitilde}25\% of global methane emissions. Interest and demand for facilitating production of Asparagopsis taxiformis has driven research into developing methods to grow it in tanks, terrestrially. In regions where it is a non-native species, potentially, it will be unable to survive under the prevailing conditions, and there may also be issues with introduction to open environments. Research has focussed on tank cultivation of the tetrasporophytic stage of Asparagopsis sp. Research has identified the key antimethanogenic component within biomass of Asparagopsis sp. is a halogenated metabolite, bromoform. It is theorised that the respective life stage of different lineages of A. taxiformis produces different concentrations of bromoform and this is related to cultivation conditions. This thesis focused on vegetative growth and biochemical composition of the gametophytic stage of A. taxiformis, Lineage 2 (CCAP 1341/1), in a series of commercially available photobioreactors analogous to land-based tanks. Photobioreactors were set to observe growth and biochemical content in comparable natural conditions of Scotland and its native region, Naples, Italy. The first photobioreactor, Algem, showed that the growth conditions in the native region were preferable for increasing biomass yield. The second photobioreactor, CYCLOPS, did not reflect the previous experimental findings. Variances were found in biochemical content of the material produced from either photobioreactor experiment. It was indicated that iodine content, cited as potentially being at toxic levels in wild-type biomass, was {\textasciitilde}50-80 times less. The analysis of bromoform content in any of the biomaterial was unsuccessful, with reasons later identified. This project demonstrated that cultivation of the gametophytic stage of A. taxiformis in closed culture systems is viable, with methods to analyse and sustain bromoform content needing refinement.},

The red seaweed Asparagopsis armata is a non-native opportunistic species, widely distributed in the European coasts of the North Atlantic, where it has been considered invasive. In this work, we examined the effects of temperature and irradiance on the vegetative propagation process of this species in a laboratory experiment. We considered vegetative propagation due to its implications in the invasion process (as it is considered one of the main sources of recruitment). In gametophytes, the process was characterized through the survival rates of hook-shaped specialized structures and the production and growth of new plantlets from hooks of 1-3cm in length. In tetrasporophytes, the growth and phycobiliprotein contents of previously excised tufts was analyzed. For gametophytes, results revealed how vegetative propagation for this species was conditioned by the low survival rates of hooks once detached from the main thallus. In our experiment, survival probabilities after 30 days of culture were always below 50\%. Comparisons among environmental conditions showed lower survival rates under increasing levels of temperature and decreasing levels of irradiance. In fact, mass mortality was detected at 18°C and low irradiance, where almost any hook-shaped fragment survived. Nevertheless, patterns of appearance and growth of plantlets at different temperatures and irradiances were not clear. In the case of tetrasporophytes, only positive growth rates were registered at 15°C and 55-60 µmol/m2/s after 30 days of culture. Higher concentration of phycobiliproteins was detected at higher temperatures during the first days of culture, while not clear patterns were detected at the end. In the light of climate change, understanding these reproduction patterns is necessary in order to adopt better management actions in the future.},

Fragmentation of this alga to seed ropes at a commercial seaweed farm seems to maintain the populations of this introduced species. Without this commercial seaweed farm A. armata would probably not flourish on the Irish west coast and this farm appears to act as a source pool for the populations. The sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of Irish waters are suitable for growth, survival and asexual reproduction of the tetrasporophyte and gametophyte; however, they may not be warm enough for sexual reproduction. The effect of temperature on the life cycle and distribution are discussed. Three species, i.e., Ulva lactuca, Plocamium cartilagineum and Cryptopleura ramosa, were hosts for epiphytic A. armata in summer in over 60\% of the collected samples.},

	url = {http://doi.org/10.26190/unsworks/17535},
	abstract = {Evolutionary processes in any population depend upon patterns of phenotypic variation available to selection and their underlying heritability. In this thesis, I used the filamentous red seaweed Asparagopsis armata, with particular focus on its modularity, to test several key questions underlying its growth-form evolution in heterogeneous environments. I established that experimental manipulations of light quantity and quality mimicking variation in underwater light due to shading or depth induce growthform plasticity in A. armata that may be evolutionarily significant given its variability among clones. Current patterns of plasticity displayed by A. armata appear adaptive, moreover, given that a reciprocal transplant of phenotypes between light environments found densely-branched (phalanx-like) phenotypes to have higher relative growth rates than sparsely-branched (guerrilla-like) phenotypes in well-lit patches, but lower relative growth rates than the latter in shaded patches. Using the capacity for rapid growth as a proxy for fitness, multivariate selection analyses identified environment-dependent patterns of directional selection on single traits coupled with linear and nonlinear selection on multi-trait combinations that shape growth-form variation within patches of differing light intensity, thereby reinforcing plasticity across light environments. Quantitative genetic analyses, however, suggest that the modular iteration of genes in morphogenesis may limit further growth-form evolution in A. armata populations exposed to spatial heterogeneity in light by constraining thallus responses to environment-dependent selection. Last, heritable responses to artificial selection on growth-form variation among clonal cell-lineages revealed the surprising capacity for A.armata to circumvent genetic constraints inherent to its development by adapting to environmental change in the absence of sexually-generated variance among clones.},

We compared thermal variability between locations and estimated the environmental optima and tolerance limits of photosynthesis to understand the relationship between phenotypic plasticity and thermal variability at each location. Photosynthetic performance was assessed using oxygen evolution and pulsed amplitude modulated fluorometry to quantify responses to thermal variation. A. taxiformis from both locations had similar high temperature tolerances for maximum net photosynthesis (Pnetmax) and maximum relative electron transport rate rETRmax ( 30°C), but different cold temperature tolerances. Respiration rates from both locations (summer and winter) always increased above 25°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence yield from dark-adapted samples from both locations decreased at warmer temperatures in the winter and at colder temperatures during the summer. Populations exposed to greater thermal variability (across both short and long time scales) displayed greater capacity for photosynthetic acclimatization. A. taxiformis from California showed seasonal changes in photosynthetic performance within the environmental temperature range (14–21°C), whereas individuals from Hawaii did not. The narrower temperature tolerance (short-term response) of subtropical Asparagopsis may make it more susceptible than temperate populations to the predicted increases in global sea surface temperatures. Acclimatization of photosynthesis may play an important role in enabling A. taxiformis to respond to a variable environment and to persist in different biogeographic regions.},

The red seaweed Asparagopsis is currently considered the most efficient feed additive to suppress methane emissions from enteric fermentation but is not currently available on commercial scale. The ongoing effort to successfully commercialize Asparagopsis requires the development of pest control frameworks which rely on the quantitative assessment of biological contamination in cultures. Here we present a low-cost readily available approach for quantifying biofouling in Asparagopsis taxiformis cultures based on microscopic examination and automated image analysis. The proposed methodology is demonstrated to estimate contamination associated with Asparagopsis biomass with error rates lower than 2\% over a wide range of contamination levels and contaminating organisms, while significantly cutting down image processing time and allowing for frequent contamination quantification.},

However, cultivation methods for Asparagopsis are nascent and fundamental information on reproduction, which is essential for large-scale cultivation, is lacking. In this study we examined asexual propagation in Asparagopsis armata, the regrowth of fragments and mechanisms of attachment to assess the potential for fragments to be used in sea-based cultivation. Asparagopsis armata gametophytes grow specialised structures, barbs, that hook fragments onto substrata. Surveys revealed barbs were abundant occurring at {\textasciitilde} 1 barb every 3–4 cm on gametophyte branches. Barbs did not regrow, but fronds did, either when attached to a barb or on their own. In contrast, fronds doubled in size with most developing barbs within 4 weeks. Barbs were, however, critical for the reattachment of fragments: barbs attached to substrata at four times the rate of frond fragments without barbs and they also attached in higher proportions to mussel rope than polypropylene rope, and two types of net. Utilising fragmentation for the propagation of A. armata gametophytes in sea-based cultivation requires that fragments can attach to a substratum and regrow once attached. We have shown that A. armata fragments in Tasmania require barbs for attachment and frond tissue for growth, which has implications for cultivation. Optimising fragmentation, attachment and out-planting methods are important future steps in establishing fragmentation as a method for sea-based cultivation in A. armata.},

Experiments were conducted in outdoor tanks at 4 combinations of carbon and nitrogen levels under reduced solar radiation. In vivo chl a fluorescence parameters and pigment contents were monitored to assess diurnal physiological responses and potential for recovery. Strong fluctuations in chl a fluorescence parameters, but not in chl a content, were observed in response to diurnal variation in solar radiation and light climate within the tanks; sensitivity varied between algal species and, in some cases, depended on the carbon and nitrogen regime. Nitrogen uptake was similarly high in U. rigida and E. elongata and lowest in C. tamariscifolia. In U. rigida and E. elongata, chl a concentrations decreased after high-carbon treatments. Effective photosystem II quantum efficiency was reduced in all species at noon, and lowest in C. tamariscifolia. The results highlight the complexity of physiological short-term acclimations which were most likely linked to biochemical changes at the cellular level.

A good example is the red algal genus Asparagopsis. The two species (A. armata and A. taxiformis) recognized in this genus have been introduced in many places around the world. Within the nominal species A. taxiformis, previous molecular analyses have uncovered several lineages, suggesting the existence of sister species or subspecies. Although the genus has been well studied in some regions (e.g., the Mediterranean Sea and Hawaii), it remains poorly investigated in others (e.g., South Pacific). Our study mainly focused on these latter areas to clarify lineages and better determine lineage status (i.e., native vs. introduced). A total of 188 specimens were collected from 61 sites, 58 of which had never been sampled before. We sequenced the DNA from samples for three markers and obtained 112 sequences for the chloroplastic RuBisCo spacer, 118 sequences for the nuclear LSU rRNA gene, and 174 for the mitochondrial spacer cox2-3. Phylogenetic analyses using all three markers suggested the existence of two cryptic sister species with the discovery of a new clade within A. armata. This clade was found only in Western Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand, and is thus restricted to a subregional biogeographic unit. We also discovered a new, fifth lineage for A. taxiformis restricted to the South Pacific and Western Australia. Except for this newly described lineage, all other lineages showed a global distribution influenced by introduction events. These results illustrate the difficulty in accurately defining cosmopolitan species. Our findings also highlight the need for targeted (i.e., in poorly studied areas) and geographically extensive sampling efforts when studying taxa that have been introduced globally and that are likely to hide species complexes.},

Macroscopic life stages that characterize the life cycle, gametophytes, and tetrasporophytes, present different morphologic, photosynthetic, physiological, and ecological features, which may aid in the course of an invasive process. Asparagopsis presence lowers diversity and abundance of native macroalgal communities. Despite hosting a relatively high number of epiphytes and epifauna, lower numbers are consistently found in these invasive species when compared to native flora. The chemical composition of A. armata and A. taxiformis and thus, its commercial applications have been studied since the 1970s. Recently, the discovery of its properties as a potent methane release inhibitor from ruminant animals has boosted a renewed scientific, media, and commercial interest in the genus.

Therefore, this study examined the interactive effects of temperature (15 °C, 18 °C and 21 °C), irradiance (15 and 30 μmol photons m−2 s−1) and photoperiod (12 h L:12 h D and 8 h L:16 h D), and nutrient concentration (F/8 and F/4) and water flow (0.6 L min −1) on the development and growth of juvenile gametophytes of A. armata across two controlled laboratory experiments. Temperature and water flow had the greatest effect on the length of gametophytes, which was highest at 18 °C and with water flow. Gametophytes developed rapidly and were consistently largest when exposed to a 12 h L:12 h D photoperiod and growth increased when individuals were maintained at 15 μmol photons m−2 s−1 compared to 30 μmol photons m−2 s−1 under a 12 h L:12 h D photoperiod. Nutrients did not limit growth at either concentration, although contamination increased with increasing nutrient concentration and irradiance. Water flow is highly recommended during nursery cultivation of A. armata as this resulted in almost double the overall biomass productivity compared to static treatments. This work identifies critical parameters for enhancing development and growth during the early life stages of A. armata and provides fundamental information to facilitate system-specific upscaling and enable larger scale nursery production.},

	abstract = {Ruminant farming represents the largest anthropogenic source of methane, a greenhouse gas with {\textasciitilde}30 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. To reduce enteric methane production in ruminants, macroalgae, such as Asparagopsis (Rhodophyta), have been trialed as feed additives. In vivo trials have reported up to a 98 \% reduction in methane from cattle, when Asparagopsis taxiformis is included in their feed at 0.2 \% organic matter. These observations have been widely attributed to the high bromoform content of Asparagopsis. However, inclusion of Asparagopsis has also been shown to adversely impact production of volatile fatty acids and feed intake. There are inconsistent results reported in the literature surrounding the effects of bromoform-containing seaweeds on ruminants, with the cause of rumen modification from in vivo trials not fully elucidated. On top of this, there are current difficulties surrounding the cultivation and distribution of Asparagopsis, both presenting barriers to its implementation on large scales. Further, detailed studies are required to implement this technology in a manner that is safe and effective for both animals and humans. This review aims to provide an overview of the current scientific standings of this technology and summarises the areas which require further investigation.},

Invasive behavior of each Asparagopsis OTU was inferred from phylogeographic reconstructions, past historical demographic dynamics, recent range expansion assessments and future distributional predictions obtained from demographic models. Genealogical networks resolved Asparagopsis gametophytes and tetrasporophytes into four A. taxiformis and one A. armata cryptic OTUs. Falkenbergia isolates ofA. taxiformis L3 were recovered for the first time in the western Mediterranean Sea and represent a new introduction for this area. Neutrality statistics supported past range expansion for A. taxiformis L1 and L2 in Hawaii. On the other hand, extreme geographic expansion and an increase in effective population size were found only for A. taxiformis L2 in the western Mediterranean Sea. Distribution models predicted shifts of the climatically suitable areas and population expansion for A. armata L1 and A. taxiformis L1 and L2. Our integrated study confirms a high invasive risk for A. taxiformis L1 and L2 in temperate and tropical areas. Despite the differences in predictions among modelling approaches, a number of regions were identified as zones with high invasion risk for A. taxiformis L2. Since range shifts are likely climate‐driven phenomena, future invasive behavior cannot be excluded for the rest of the lineages.},

	abstract = {Field evidence is essential to assess the consequences of climate change but a solid causal link often requires additional information obtained under controlled laboratory conditions. Additionally, the functional response to temperature may also help to discriminate species potentially more vulnerable to warming. Using a highly resolved temperature gradient, we examined the temperature dependence of photosynthesis and respiration in eight intertidal seaweeds that recently followed opposite abundance trends in NW Iberia. The temperature dependence of photosynthesis was consistently different between the macroalgae that increased and those that decreased their abundance in the last decade and a half, with photosynthesis twice more sensitive in the upward group. Unlike photosynthesis, the temperature dependence of respiration was unrelated to the abundance trend group, implying that the net metabolic scaling with temperature varied between the two groups of seaweeds. Overall, our results provide experimental support to the role of temperate as a likely driver of the changes in abundance recorded by field-monitoring studies. They also suggest that the temperature dependence of photosynthesis and respiration assessed in short-term experiments may serve as a biomarker of the potential vulnerability of some seaweed to the consequences of water warming.},

The red seaweed genus Asparagopsis (Bonnemaisoniales, Rhodophyta) comprises two recognised morpho-species characterised by heteromorphic life cycles and presumably morphologically identical ‘Falkenbergia’ tetrasporophyte stages: A. armata and A. taxiformis. Populations of the former were easily identiﬁed by the presence of distinctive harpoon-like braches on the gametophyte thalli. Four morphologically cryptic yet genetically distinct mitochondrial lineages of invasive nature were recognised within A. taxiformis. We reported a morphological delineation of tetrasporophytes and gametophytes of Asparagopsis, including cryptic lineages collected from the Mediterranean Sea and the Hawaiian Islands, where multiple Asparagopsis lineages were present. Vegetative anatomical characters of the tetrasporophytes were useful in differentiating A. armata from those of A. taxiformis as well as among tetrasporophyte isolates belonging to the four A. taxiformis lineages. In addition, these characters distinguished lineage 2 native range specimens (Hawaii) from the invasive specimens (Mediterranean Sea), which suggested high levels of morphological plasticity in the invasive taxon. We propose that the taxonomic status of the lineages within A. taxiformis needs to be revised.},

	abstract = {The tetrasporophyte of Asparagopsis armata has been previously established as a novel seaweed biofilter for integrated land-based mariculture. The species growth and biofiltration rates were much higher than the values described in the literature for Ulva spp., the most common seaweed biofilter. However, a validation of the advantage of one species over the other requires a study of the performances of these two species in the same system at the same time. In this work, we compared the biofiltration performance and biomass yield of A. armata and Ulva rigida cultivated in the effluents of a fish farm in southern Portugal. Comparisons were performed at different water renewal rates and in two seasons of the year. The maximum total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal rates were similar for both species in December (2.7 and 2.8 g TAN m–2 day–1 for U. rigida and A. armata, respectively) and higher for A. armata (6.5 g TAN m–2 day–1) than for U. rigida (5.1 g TAN m–2 day–1) in May. Higher differences were observed when estimating the nitrogen biofiltration through the organic nitrogen yield (N yield) of the biomass produced, particularly in May. This estimate is directly related with the biomass yield and the N content in the tissue which were always higher for A. armata than for U. rigida. In December, the maximum biomass yields were 71 g dry weight (DW) m–2 day–1 for A. armata and 44 g DW m–2 day–1 for U. rigida, while in May, the yield of A. armata was 125 g DW m–2 day–1 and of U. rigida was 73 g DW m–2 day–1. This study confirmed that A. armata is indeed a more efficient biofilter than U. rigida. To the best of our knowledge, the production rates reported here are the highest ever reported for macroalgae cultivated in tanks.},

We further tested whether biomass variations were related to environmental variables at the study site. Gametophytes were present year-round while tetrasporophytes were only found in spring and summer. Recruitment capacity and vegetative growth of the gametophytes are discussed as important modulators for the population structure and enhancers of its persistence. Thallus size-time histograms revealed a high prevalence of small shoots that showed high mortality that was not related to self-thinning. Biomass of A. taxiformis was higher from March to July. Vegetative growth was the main way the gametophyte population was maintained, although the presence of tetrasporophytes and fertile gametophytes in the ﬁeld conﬁrms that sexual reproduction also occurs. Its continuous and high recruitment, in terms of the number of smallest shoots, makes this southern population of A. taxiformis a source of future invasive populations due to the intensive maritime trafﬁc in the region.},

Both internal nitrogen content and growth rate varied substantially, and the quantitative and qualitative changes in amino acids were described in the context of three internal nitrogen states: nitrogen-limited, metabolic, and luxury. The nitrogen limited state was defined by increases in all amino acids with increasing nitrogen content and growth up until 1.2\% internal nitrogen. The metabolic nitrogen state was defined by increases in all amino acids with increasing internal nitrogen content up to 2.6\%, with no increases in growth rate. Luxury state was defined by internal nitrogen content above 2.6\%, which occurred only when nitrogen availability was high but growth rates were reduced. In this luxury circumstance, excess nitrogen was accumulated as free amino acids, in two phases. The first phase was distinguished by a small increase in the majority of amino acids up to ≈3.3\% internal nitrogen, and the second by a large increase in glutamic acid, glutamine, and arginine up to 4.2\% internal nitrogen. These results demonstrate that the relationship between internal nitrogen content and amino acid quality is dynamic but predictable, and could be used for the selective culture of seaweeds.},

	abstract = {The red seaweed Asparagopsis armata (Harvey; Rhodophytae, Bonnemaisoniaceae) produces biologically active secondary metabolites that are valuable natural ingredients for cosmetics and medicine and its cultivation may therefore be a profitable venture. The tetrasporophyte of this species (“Falkenbergia rufolanosa”) was successfully tank-cultivated as a continuous biofilter for the effluent of a commercial fish farm in southern Portugal. Optimal stocking density for highest biomass yield and a low level of other algal species in winter and late spring was 5×g centrifuged fresh weight l−1. The effect of total ammonia nitrogen supply (TAN flux) on biofiltration and biomass yield was investigated in winter and spring. Results revealed that A. armata is currently the seaweed-biofilter with the highest TAN removal of up to 90 μmol l−1 h−1 at a TAN flux of about 500 μmol l−1 h−1. In the tanks used, this is equivalent to a removal of up to 14.5 g TAN m−2 day−1. At a lower TAN flux of about 40 μmol l−1 h−1, TAN removal by A. armata is more than double to what is reported at this flux for another successful seaweed biofilter, the genus Ulva. Monthly variation of A. armata biomass yield peaked in May and was lowest in January. At TAN fluxes between 300 and 400 μmol l−1 h−1, an average water temperature of 21.7 °C and a total daily photon flux density of 47 Mol m−2, seaweed yield was over 100 g DW m−2 day−1 with a recorded maximum of 119 g. During spring, autumn and early summer, the biomass of A. armata within the experimental tanks doubled every week. A model for the up scaling of this finfish integrated aquaculture of A. armata varies the investment in biofilter surface area and estimates the return in biofiltration and biomass yield. Highest TAN removal efficiencies will only be possible at low TAN fluxes and a very large biofilter area, resulting in a low production of biomass per unit area. To remove 50\% of TAN from the effluent (1 mt Sparus aurata; 21 °C), 28 m2 of biofilter, designed to support a water turnover rate of 0.8 Vol h−1 would be necessary. This system produces 6.1 kg FW (1.5 kg DW) of A. armata per day and has the potential to turn biofiltration into an economically sustained, beneficial side effect.},

	abstract = {Over the last several years there has been increased interest in large scale cultivation of the red seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis due to its ability to reduce methane emissions in ruminant animals. However, research focused on developing strategies to optimize culture conditions for this alga is still relatively scarce. Both light quality and quantity are widely known to differentially influence any alga's photosynthetic rates, metabolic budgets and ultimately biomass and bio-active compound production. Optimization of cultivation conditions for algae requires the understanding and fine-tuning of light parameters including Photon Flux Density (PFD), light spectrum, and photoperiod, as well as culture density which largely governs light quantity (PFD) and quality (spectrum) within the culture. Here we explore the effects of light intensity, spectral light distribution, and day length on the physiological performance of the tetrasporophyte stage of A. taxiformis in culture using a series of experiments. The results were used to characterize the optimal light and biomass density range for cultivation, and a model was developed to optimize the light path in a cultivation vessel. Spectral light optimization revealed a significant reduction in cyanobacterial contamination for cultures illuminated with blue LED light. Artificially extending light duration longer than 12 h per day did not improve algal growth. The insights gained from these experimental results may be used to inform the design of tank-based A. taxiformis cultivation systems to support high yield and stable production of this emerging commercial crop.},

	abstract = {The red seaweed genus Asparagopsis Montagne (Bonnemaisoniales) contains two widely introduced species that are considered notorious seaweed invaders worldwide, Asparagopsis armata and A. taxiformis, both characterised by heteromorphic, diplo-haplontic life histories. To uncover cryptic introductions of Asparagopsis along the South African coastline and identify ‘Falkenbergia’ isolates (i.e. tetrasporophytic life-history phase morphologically identical between species), the mitochon-drial cox2–3 spacer was sequenced from gametophytes of Asparagopsis taxiformis from Scottburgh, KwaZulu-Natal, on the East Coast, Knysna Lagoon on the South Coast and from tetrasporophytes, otherwise unidentifiable to species level, collected from False Bay near Cape Town on the South-West Coast and Tsitsikamma on the South Coast. Only tetrasporophytes of the temperate Asparagopsis armata were encountered from the Cape Peninsula (Cape Town) probably as far east as to Port St Johns, Eastern Cape province. This is considered an introduced species, and was first collected at Kommetjie (Cape Peninsula) in 1935. Gametophytes of the warm-temperate to tropical A. taxiformis were first collected at Reunion Rocks near Durban in 1984; the KwaZulu-Natal material studied here belongs to an Atlantic Mediterranean cryptic lineage. This taxon is an ecological dominant in some intertidal and shallow subtidal areas in northern KwaZulu-Natal, and is thus considered ‘introduced’ and ‘invasive’. In contrast, A. taxiformis gametophytes, collected in Knysna Lagoon in 2008, clustered with individuals of Indo-Pacific lineage 2. The latter is considered a major invasive lineage in the western Mediterranean, but at present is categorised as introduced in South Africa. This study provides molecular evidence of three independent, cryptic introductions in South Africa, one of them probably very recent, and this is discussed with respect to potential vectors responsible for transport.},

	abstract = {In vivo chlorophyll fluorescence measured by pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry was used as an indicator of photosynthetic activity in tank-cultivated red algae [ Gracilaria cornea and Asparagopsis armata (tetrasporophyte phase, previously known as Falkenbergia rufolanosa )] using effluent seawater from sea bream fishponds (Sparus aurata ). Optimal quantum yield of indoor-grown G. cornea did not change during the period analysed (2 months). In contrast, optimal quantum yield decreased drastically in algae transferred from indoor to outdoor conditions. Maximal electron transport rate increased and photosynthetic pigments decreased in algae growing outdoors, indicating an acclimation to high irradiance. After 16 days, chlorophyll fluorescence decreased drastically and recovered partially when algae were transferred again from outdoor to indoor conditions. Falkenbergia rufolanosa was grown at three different biomass densities (4, 6 and 8 g l -1 ). The effects of three consecutive air compressor failure events on the photosynthetic activity were followed. An apparent degradation of the physiological conditions of the algae (resulting in their bleaching) was observed, concomitant with a strong decrease in the optimal quantum yield. This decrease was higher at algal biomass densities of 4 g l -1 than at 6 or 8 g l -1 . Three days after transfer to optimal conditions, i.e., normal aeration conditions, optimal quantum yield reached values around 0.50–0.55, close to the values before stress conditions. The results revealed that the use of chlorophyll fluorescence is a powerful means to rapidly detect different stress situations in integrated cultivation of seaweeds using fishpond effluents. In particular, the optimal quantum yield of algae can be monitored regularly as an early warning of the physiological stress in cultures.},

Carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment can be used to overcome Ci limitation and enhance productivity of algae in intensive culture, however, it is unclear whether algal species with the ability to utilise bicarbonate (HCO3−) as a carbon source for photosynthesis will benefit from CO2 enrichment. This study quantified the HCO3− affinity of three green tide algal species, Cladophora coelothrix, Cladophora patentiramea and Chaetomorpha linum, targeted for biomass and bioenergy production. Subsequently, we quantified productivity and carbon, nitrogen and ash content in response to CO2 enrichment. All three species had similar high pH compensation points (9.7–9.9), and grew at similar rates up to pH 9, demonstrating HCO3− utilization. Algal cultures enriched with CO2 as a carbon source had 30\% more total Ci available, supplying twenty five times more CO2 than the control. This higher Ci significantly enhanced the productivity of Cladophora coelothrix (26\%), Chaetomorpha linum (24\%) and to a lesser extent for Cladophora patentiramea (11\%), compared to controls. We demonstrated that supplying carbon as CO2 can enhance the productivity of targeted green tide algal species under intensive culture, despite their clear ability to utilise HCO3−.},

A deterministic model was reformulated as a Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) with uncertainty in the parameters accounted for using "prior" distributions and unresolved time varying processes modelled using auto-regressive processes. Observations of kelp grown in 3 seeding densities around salmon pens were assimilated using a Sequential Monte Carlo method implemented within the LibBi package. This resulted in a considerable reduction in the variability in model output for both the observed and unobserved state variables. A reduction in variance between the prior and posterior was observed for a subset of model parameters which varied with seeding density. Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence method showed the reduction in variability of the state and parameters was approximately 90\%. A low to medium seeding density results in the most efficient removal of excess nutrients in this simple system.},

	abstract = {The effects of 16 different combinations of nutrient load and agitation on yield, nutrient uptake and proximate chemical composition of the seaweed Ulva lactuca cultured in tanks were evaluated. Intensive fishpond outflow passed through seaweed tanks at four nutrient loading levels and four water agitation combinations of water exchange, bottom aeration and frequently changing water levels (an accelerated tide regime). Specific results from these outdoor experiments were examined further under controlled conditions in laboratory experiments. Agitation treatments affected the performance of U. lactuca only under TAN (NH3 + NH4+) load levels below 4 g N m-2 day-1; biofiltration of TAN was the parameter most affected. Biomass yields at each of the four nutrient loading levels were not significantly different between the agitation treatments. Protein content increased significantly with increasing nutrient loading. The agitation treatments had a slight effect on seaweed protein content only at the lowest nutrient loading levels. There were no significant differences in dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, and temperature among the agitation treatments at all nutrient loading levels. Under laboratory conditions, growth rates, protein content, and photosynthetic and biomass yield of the seaweed were affected by water velocity under low nutrient concentrations. It is concluded that the effect of air agitation under the conditions of these experiments was not directly related to photosynthesis, excess dissolved oxygen, or carbon limitation, but to the diffusion of macro nutrients from the water to the seaweed. Therefore, once nutrient concentrations are high enough (above about 4 μM of TAN with the other nutrients in their corresponding proportions), aeration per se is not essential for effective growth and biofiltration by seaweeds. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Salinity can affect the quantity and quality of total amino acids (TAAs) in seaweeds indirectly by altering growth rates and thereby diluting or concentrating the amino acid content of the biomass, or directly by altering the synthesis of specific amino acids and osmolytes. This study attempted to partition the indirect and direct effects of salinity on the quantity and quality of TAAs in the green seaweed Ulva ohnoi by culturing it under a range of salinities without nutrient limitation. Both the quantity and quality of TAAs varied across the salinity treatments. Quantity was most strongly related to the growth rate of the seaweed and was highest in the slowest growing seaweed. In contrast, the quality of TAAs (individual amino acids as a proportion of total content) was most strongly related to salinity for all amino acids, although this varied substantially among individual amino acids. Increases in salinity were positively correlated with the proportion of proline (46\% increase), tyrosine (36\% increase), and histidine (26\% increase), whereas there was a negative correlation with alanine (29\% decrease). The proportion of methionine, with strong links to the synthesis of the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate, did not correlate linearly with salinity and instead was moderately higher at the optimal salinities for growth. These results show that salinity simultaneously affects the quantity and quality of TAAs in seaweed through both indirect and direct mechanisms, with growth rates playing the overarching role in determining the quantity of TAAs.},

We compared globally collected mitochondrial cox2-3 intergenic spacer sequences with sequences produced from multiple Australian locations and South Korea to identify Asparagopsis lineages and to reveal cryptic introductions. We report A. taxiformis lineage 4 from Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Australia, and the highly invasive Indo-Pacific Mediterranean lineage 2 from South Korea and Lord Howe Island, Australia. Phylogeographic analysis showed a clear haplotype and geographic separation between western Australian and Great Barrier Reef (GBR) isolates belonging to the recently described lineage 5. The same lineage, however, was characterized by a substantial genetic and geographic break between the majority of Australian specimens and Asparagopsis collections from South Solitary Island, Southern GBR, Lord Howe Island, Kermadec Islands, Norfolk Island, New Caledonia and French Polynesia. The disjunct geographic distribution and sequence divergence between these two groups supports the recognition of a sixth cryptic A. taxiformis mitochondrial lineage. As climatic changes accelerate the relocation of biota and offer novel niches for colonization, periodic surveys for early detection of cryptic invasive seaweeds will be critical in determining whether eradication or effective containment of the aliens are feasible.},

We present the reproductive phenology of a population located in southern Spain and a quantitative study of gametophyte reproductive structures. Reproductive allocation (the proportion of biomass allocated to reproductive tissue) in different size classes was analysed to investigate whether the shoot size influences the reproductive output of this population. Gametophytes were found to be reproductive in spring, autumn and the beginning of winter, whereas fertile tetrasporophytes were never observed. High reproductive performance was recorded in July, when reproductive allocation was surprisingly low (12.74±4.79\%). Reproductive allocation of each size class varied over the study period, ensuring a continuous reproductive yield. The shoot size for reproduction ranged between 4–6 cm and 24–26 cm. An analysis of reproductive and vegetative volume suggested that reproductive allocation decreases with shoot size, which, as intermediate size classes are the most abundant and most persistent in the field throughout the year, optimizes the reproductive output. Reproduction in gametophytes was independent of environmental conditions in the study area. The yearly persistence of gametophytes together with the abundance of tetrasporophytes makes this population a donor source for future invasive populations.},

Native community was represented by 18 Rhodophyta, 3 Chlorophyta and 4 Ochrophyta species. Biomass was dominated by A. taxiformis and Halopteris filicina. While in January A. taxiformis accounted for only 16\% of the community biomass, an explosive dominance was observed only two months later, representing more than 90\% of the algal biomass. Furthermore, low and generally stable values of species richness, Shannon’s diversity index and evenness were recorded during the study period. Given that A. taxiformis gametophytes are present year round, they are likely to pose a constant stress to native community development.

It is among the edible seaweeds that can bring down the pressure on to the terrestrial crop farming. The cultivation of such economically valuable species presents two major advantages: their higher photosynthetic eﬃciency that leads to the higher level of atmospheric CO2 sequestration and the biomass produced can eﬀectively be employed in food formulations to combat the food security issues. In this study, the optimum concentration of nutrients namely, nitrate and phosphate were estimated to maximize the biomass production to achieve higher growth rates with the best biochemical contents. The optimization of nutrient regimes resulted in the modulation of algal cell-cycle as evidenced by the highly varying growth rates (ranging from 6\% to 56\%) as well as dynamic nutrient uptake kinetics. The biochemical analysis of biomass grown in optimized nutrient combination (N2: 60 μM nitrate; 6 μM phosphate) contained proteins 9.3 ± 0.32\%, carbohydrates 20.2 ± 2.51\% and lipids 6.28 ± 0.84\% on dry weight basis. Further, the cultures with the optimized nutrient combination were found to have healthy green leaf-like thallus with reduced or no incidence of deterioration of biomass.

Other studies with brown and green seaweeds have observed reductions in methane production of between 20 and 45\% in vitro and 10\% in vivo. Benefits of feeding seaweeds to ruminants are seaweed specific and animal species-dependent. In some instances, positive effects on milk production and performance are observed where selected seaweeds are fed to ruminants while other studies note reductions in performance traits. A balance between reducing methane and maintaining animal health and food quality is necessary. Seaweeds are a source of essential amino acids and minerals however, and offer huge potential for use as feeds for animal health maintenance once formulations and doses are correctly prepared and administered. A negative aspect of seaweed use for animal feed currently is the cost associated with wild harvest and indeed aquaculture production and improvements must be made here if seaweed ingredients are to be used as a solution to control methane production from ruminants for continued production of animal/ruminant sourced proteins in the future. This review collates information concerning different seaweeds and how they and their constituents can reduce methane from ruminants and ensure sustainable production of ruminant proteins in an environmentally beneficial manner.},

Asparagopsis armata (Harvey, 1855) is a seaweed with high biomass production and exquisite biotechnological potential due to a myriad of produced secondary metabolites. Furthermore, it is one of the most aggressive invasive seaweed species becoming an economic and ecological problem in Europe. Simultaneously, it is a resource with market demand for its applications in cosmetics and, more recently, for its potential anti-methanogenic activity in ruminants. There is an appreciable amount of literature concerning the chemistry and the bioactivity of this seaweed species (and particularly its gametophyte, the focus of this review), as well as multiple products in the cosmetics market, but all this information is scattered and therefore poorly used. To potentiate the bioindustry of A. armata, the available scientific knowledge is here reviewed and an overview of the market for this species is comprehensively provided. Thus, the chemical composition of A. armata (primary metabolism, polysaccharide characteristics, amino acid profile, and non-halogenated and halogenated secondary metabolites), its bioactivities (antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antiprotozoal, antioxidant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, among others) and the existent, marketed extracts (cosmetic ingredients) are thoroughly compiled and discussed herein.},

However, invasive seaweeds are suitable for industrial applications due to their high feedstock. Hence, seaweeds’ historical use in daily food diet, allied to research findings, showed that macroalgae are a source of nutrients and bioactive compounds with nutraceutical properties.

	abstract = {Seaweeds have been receiving increased interest from the fisheries and  aquaculture industries in recent years, with red algae continuing to be one of the more  important components of seaweed aquaculture representing 54\% of the harvested biomass  (around US\$ 6.3 billion). These seaweeds are important for both food and diverse of  biotechnology usages. Asparagopsis taxiformis, a characteristic red alga, has been  receiving increased attention for its biotechnological applications, the most interesting  one being its ability to reduce methane emissions on the cattle. A. taxiformis presents a  triphasic life history, passing from gametophyte to carposporophyte and finally to  tetrasporophyte. The conditions for the lab manipulation and survival of this species are  still not know, taking in consideration the difficulty of maintaining gametophyte cultures.  In this work, some abiotic factors affecting gametophyte maintenance and  reproduction were experimentally tested. A. taxiformis gametophyte did not survive any  common pretreatment used, only surviving in culture if cleaned of epizoa in sterilized  filtered seawater and by selecting the less epiphyted individuals. A. taxiformis showed the  highest growth rate when cultivated at 15 oC, not growing at 20 oC and dying at 25 oC.  An industrial fertilizer used showed similar growth rates compared to the Von Stosch  medium. Photoperiod manipulation did not result in any sexual differentiation on the  gametophytes. A low stock density (1 g/L) was required since at higher densities there  was reduced (2 g/L) or no (4g/L) growth rate. A. taxiformis was able to grow at both 20  and 40 μmol photon m-2 s-1, showing slightly higher (but not significant) growth rates at  the latter. Attempts at inducing carposporophyte formation were unsuccessful.  Temperature and light intensity were the two most important factors to maintain  gametophyte culture.},

	abstract = {Asparagopsis taxiformis, a widely distributed tropical-subtropical red seaweed (Rhodophyta,  order Bonnemaisoniales), is native to the Hawaiian Islands. This species is highly valued as a  food condiment in Hawaiʻi because of its pungent flavor. Asparagopsis taxiformis has high  concentrations of halogenated secondary metabolites with antibacterial and antiviral activity that  may have powerful medicinal value. Although a related species in Portugal, A. armata, is being  successfully grown in tank culture, little is known about the biotic and abiotic conditions needed  by A. taxiformis to progress through each life phase. This project tested culture conditions that  promote growth and reproduction of each life phase of A. taxiformis.  Tetrasporophyte growth was highest at 24 μmol photons m-2 s-1 when cultured in half strength  PES media at 21-23°C, 12L:12D, under cool white fluorescent bulbs. Gametophytes did not  survive in flask culture under any of the conditions tested due to contamination, although  isolation of apical tips using agar was effective in beginning unialgal gametophyte petri dish  culture. Optimal conditions for inducing carpospore release involved immersing fertile female  thalli in filtered seawater in complete darkness for 16 hours, at 21-23°C. Peak spore release  occurred four hours after fluorescent lights came on. Germination rates were similar when  spores were grown in both f/2 and PES media. Analysis of historic spatial and temporal  distribution of herbaria specimens indicated that gametophytes grow on both leeward and  windward coasts of Hawaiʻi, during both wet and dry seasons. Phenological data suggested that  laboratory conditions probably play a bigger role in carpospore release and germination than the  environmental parameters observed in the four weeks antecedent to collection. This research reveals that a unialgal culture of A. taxiformis may be begun from wild-collected gametophyte  thalli, and grown successfully in culture through at least part of its life cycle.},

	abstract = {The formation of tetrasporangia in Falkenbergia-phase tetrasporophytes of Asparagopsis armata Harvey (Rhodophyta : Bonnemaisoniales) isolated from introduced populations in Ireland and Italy, and from native populations in Victoria, Australia, was examined in temperature-controlled water-baths at 2°C intervals from 11–23°C and at 1- or 0.5-h daylength intervals from 8–12 h. At a daylength of 8 h, Irish plants formed tetrasporangia only at (15-)17(−21)°C, Italian plants at 17–21dgC and Australian plants at 13–17°C. However, after an incubation period of 5 wk, only the Italian consistently showed 100\% reproduction under these conditions. At 17°C, the critical daylength for tetrasporogensis is 8–9 h for the Irish and Australian strains and 9–10 h for the Italian strain. These results indicate that all three isolates differ in their response to environmental variables. It is likely that the Mediterranean and Irish populations thus represent separate introductions into the Northern Hemisphere and that Australia was not the source of these plants. The abundance of gametophytes of this species at Messina, Sicily, in April and May is explained by a reproductive “window” of daylength and temperature for tetrasporogenesis from mid-November to late January. In Victoria, Australia, temperatures are inductive all year but daylength at the water surface is never {\textless}9.5 h. However, it is considered that tidal ranges of 2–3 m cause the effective daylength in winter to fall below the inductive threshold. In northern Europe, the restricted geographical distribution of gametophytes is probably determined by tidally and/or topographically induced shorter daylengths in late October and November, and also by higher temperatures in the intertidal on warm days. Previously reported responses to N and P levels in enriched seawater media were not confirmed and may have resulted from incubation at suboptimal temperatures. Arsenic and iodine supplementation appears to be necessary for reproduction only in the Irish strain.},

In the current study, Ulva fasciata from a biofilter of fishpond effluent was examined for its biomass production, photosynthetic activity, nutrient uptake and activity of nitrate reductase when supplied with either ammonia or nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. The effects of prior acclimation to either nitrogen source were also studied. Cultivation of Ulva with ammonia resulted in a rapid uptake of this nutrient, whereas photosynthesis, uptake of orthophosphate and C:N ratio were greater in cultures with nitrate. The transfer of Ulva from ammonia to nitrate nutrition increased carbohydrate content in the biomass. Longer culture in nitrate did not influence photosynthetic yields, growth, or N and P uptake rate by the algae, but increased both lipid and P content in biomass. Once transferred from ammonia-rich to nitrate-rich seawater, nitrate uptake by Ulva commenced immediately, although the activity of the enzyme nitrate reductase was first detected only 28 h later. Culture of Ulva in different nitrogen forms, ammonia and nitrate, may determine application of the resulting biomass in different industries, e.g., feeding, bioethanol, biofiltration, etc., considering the rapid production of protein-rich Ulva in the presence of ammonia, while yield is lower in the presence of nitrate but the biomass contains more carbohydrates and removes P from the effluent more rapidly.},

Vegetative blade discs were exposed to temperature and salinity treatments in a 10-day laboratory experiment, and the physiological response was assessed employing photosynthetic (Fv/Fm, ETRmax) as well as biochemical parameters (chlorophyll a, xanthophylls and antioxidant pool size). U. pinnatifida sustained a high photosynthetic quantum yield in most treatments, with a negative synergistic effect on photosynthetic yield observed at 25 °C and low salinities (12, 6 SA). E. radiata died in salinities below 18 SA, except at 5 °C and L. variegata was highly susceptible to elevated temperatures (20, 25 °C). Antioxidant pool size showed species-specific responses to the experimental conditions, being most resilient in U. pinnatifida. Overall, U. pinnatifida displayed broader tolerance to the experimental salinity and temperature conditions than native kelps. The abilities to cope with a wide range in abiotic factors and to thrive in estuarine conditions might contribute to higher competitive strength compared to native kelps leading to its invasion success, especially with regard to ocean warming.},

It was, however, unclear how the detached U. prolifera responded and resumed growing after they detached from its original habitat. In this study, we investigated the growth and photosynthetic response of the detached U. prolifera to various temperature, salinity and irradiance in the laboratory. The photosynthetic rate of the detached U. prolifera was significantly higher at moderate temperature levels (14–27°C) and high salinity (26–32), with optimum at 23°C and 32. Both low ({\textless}14°C) and highest temperature (40°C), as well as low salinity (8) had adverse effects on the photosynthesis. Compared with the other Ulva species, U. prolifera showed higher saturated irradiance and no significant photoinhibition at high irradiance, indicating the great tolerance of U. prolifera to the high irradiance. The dense branch and complex structure of floating mats could help protect the thalli and reduce photoinhibition in field. Furthermore, temperature exerted a stronger influence on the growth rate of the detached U. prolifera compared to salinity. Overall, the high growth rate of this detached U. prolifera (10.6\%–16.7\% d–1) at a wide range of temperature (5–32°C) and salinity (14–32) implied its blooming tendency with fluctuated salinity and temperature during floating. The environmental parameters in the southwestern Yellow Sea at the beginning of green tide were coincident with the optimal conditions for the detached U. prolifera.},

	abstract = {Like other organisms in the marine ecosystem, macroalgae are subjected to intense environmental stresses, particularly in the intertidal zone. The green seaweed Ulva inhabits rocky intertidal zones worldwide, suggesting that this alga may be a good model system for studying environmental stress responses in marine plants. Here, we review the physiological and biochemical responses to thermal and salinity stresses in a sterile mutant of Ulva pertusa. In response to high-temperature stress, the amount of photosynthetic pigments, major free amino acids (AA), and total carbon and nitrogen in U. pertusa increase. Changes in chemical components due to high-temperature stress are consistent with morphological changes in thalli subjected to high temperature and suggest that high-temperature stress mainly affects nitrogen metabolism. Isozyme assays show that the alga expresses a glutamate dehydrogenase isozyme in response to high-temperature stress, and that its expression was regulated at the mRNA transcription level. Chemical component changes due to salinity stress indicate a possibility that the low- and high-salinity conditions affect photosynthesis and carbon and nitrogen metabolism, respectively. In particular, it was observed that thalli exposed to hypersaline conditions rapidly accumulate the organic osmolyte proline, suggesting that free proline accumulation is an important tolerance mechanism in this alga for adapting to hypersaline conditions. Finally, we discuss future directions for the molecular analysis of environmental stress in U. pertusa.},

	abstract = {The response of seaweeds to environmental stressors can be population-specific, and be related to the regime of their habitats. To explore the growth and physiological responses of Ulva prolifera, two strains of this alga (Korean and Chinese strains) were studied under an interaction of temperature (20 and 25 °C), nutrients (low nutrients: 50 μM of nitrate and 5 μM of phosphate; high nutrients: 500 μM of nitrate and 50 μM of phosphate) and salinity (20, 30 and 40 psu). The lowest growth rates of both strains were observed at 40 psu of salinity, independent of temperature and nutrient levels. At 20 °C and low nutrients condition, the carbon: nitrogen (C: N) ratio and growth rate in the Chinese strain were increased by 31.1\% and 21.1\% at a salinity of 20 psu in comparison to the salinity of 30 psu, respectively. High nutrients decreased the ratio of C:N in both strains with increasing tissue N content. At the same time, high nutrients also increased soluble protein and pigments contents, as well as photosynthetic and growth rates in both strains at the same salinity levels at 20 °C. Under 20 °C and high nutrients conditions, the growth rates and C:N ratio of both strains were significantly decreased with increasing salinity. The pigment, soluble protein and tissue N showed an inverse trend with the growth rate at all conditions. Moreover, the higher temperature of 25 °C inhibited the growth in both strains regardless of nutrients levels. The temperature of 25 °C enhanced the contents of tissue N and pigments in the Chinese strain only at the low nutrients level. The interaction of high nutrients and 25 °C led to the accumulation of tissue N and pigment contents in both strains under all salinity conditions compared to the 20 °C and high nutrients level. The temperature of 25 °C and high nutrients decreased the growth rate in the Chinese strain at both salinities of 30 and 40 psu more than the 20 °C, and low nutrients level at the same salinity. These results suggest that the Ulva blooms caused by the Chinese strain were more impacted at hypo-salinity levels compared to the Korean strain. Eutrophic or high nutrients level enhanced the salinity tolerance in both strains of U. prolifera. There will be a decline of U. prolifera blooms of the Chinese strain at hyper-salinity levels.},

	abstract = {Forecast errors of subsurface temperature and salinity are substantially reduced with an efficient, two-step, multiscale Ensemble Optimal Interpolation (EnOI) system, applied to a near-global eddy-resolving ocean model. A critical element of any data assimilation system is the background error covariance, which for EnOI is typically a static ensemble of anomalies from a long model run. Here, we construct two ensembles — one based on intraseasonal anomalies from a free run of the same eddy-resolving ocean model used to underpin the forecasts, and a second ensemble of climatogical anomalies calculated using a relatively coarse, 1-degree global ocean model. For each assimilation cycle, the coarse-resolution ensemble is used to “correct” the broad-scales, and the high-resolution ensemble is used to “correct” the eddy-scales. Corrections from the coarse steps are more effective at reducing systematic errors in the subsurface ocean whereas the high-resolution steps typically produce vertically coherent corrections associated with mesoscale eddies. We compare two configurations of multiscale data assimilation with different localisation radii in the coarse data assimilation step. The best performance and slowest error growth was found with localisation that was large enough to encompass neighbouring profiles in each assimilation cycle. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated in ocean reanalyses over 2017-8 that assimilate data every 3 days. We demonstrate clear improvements in the representation of temperature and salinity at all depths around Australia. Model-observation differences are particularly improved in and below the thermocline. The corrections to the ocean state with multiscale data assimilation follow water mass structures. The increased computational cost of this multiscale approach is modest (about double the analysis step), but the performance improvement is significant, making this approach suitable for research and operational applications.},

In all stations, the dominant species causing green tide was Ulva reticulata. There was a significant difference in Ulva biomass among study sites and time periods. As for both nitrate and phosphate, there was no significant difference among sites but showed significant effect with respect to time period, suggesting that temporal variation could be the main factor affecting the concentration of inorganic nutrients.

To evaluate seaweed metabolism and biomass compounds, elemental and biochemical composition were analyzed in the beginning and end of each experiment. Results regarding the nutrient source showed that both species removed more than 65\% of ammonium after 3 hours of experimentation. At the end of the experiments, up to 94.8\% of the initial ammonium was sequestered from the effluent. Additionally, after 5 days of cultivation under 50\% fish effluent both {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Ulva{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} species were able to remove more than 85\% of the nitrate. Although a decrease in uptake efficiency was observed in cultures with 100\% fish effluent, at the end of the experiment more than 440 µmol L$^{\textrm{-1}}$ of nitrate was removed, considering all treatment conditions. The biomass values showed that growth rates of seaweed cultivated in 100\% effluent were higher than those obtained in 50\% effluent. Moreover, when cultivated in the 100\% effluent concentration, a significant increment in protein content was detected in both {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Ulva{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} species. Our results contribute to the understanding of biofiltration and photosynthetic performance of two different {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Ulva{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} species in order to improve growth optimization, enhancement of biofiltration capacity and also to boost management practices of seaweed cultivation in aquaculture effluent treatment systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A significant linear relationship (R2 = 0.86) was found between log µmax and log SA/V with the slope 0.66 (95\% C.I.: 0.61–0.72) and the intercept −3.80[95\% C.I.: (−3.59)−(−4.00)]. One general allometric expression can therefore describe the scaling of maximal growth rate as a function of organism size over a 1,700-fold range of SA/V ratios spanning small unicellular algae as well as multicellular aquatic angiosperms. The size dependence of maximal growth rate for aquatic photosynthetic organisms is close to that expected from the well-known “¾ law,” governing the size dependence of metabolic rates in animals.},

The cells in young thalli were rectangular to polygonal in shape compactly packed in longitudinal rows with no sign of vegetative division and sporulation. In mature thalli the cells were polygonal showing vegetative division and sporulation. The chloroplast was parietal, cup-shaped with 1-3 pyrenoids at St.1 and 3-4 pyrenoids at St. 2. Variability in biomass, length, and cell diameters between populations of two stations was observed. At St. 1 sporulation was observed in most of the thalli and at St. 2 reproduction was by means of vegetative fragmentation throughout the year. At St. 1 blooms occurred during period of high sporulation whereas at St. 2 such blooms were common during peak of vegetative propagation.},

	abstract = {The seasonal cycle of biomass and tissue composition of Ulva rigida C. Agardh, in relation to nitrogen availability in the water column, was studied in 1991–1992 in the Sacca di Goro, a highly eutrophic lagoon in the Po River Delta (Italy). Nitrate uptake rates and storage capacity were also determined in laboratory experiments. The seasonal growth of U. rigida was related to the seasonal trend of nitrogen concentration in the water column. U. rigida biomass increased exponentially during spring and attained peaks of about 300–400 g dry mass (DM) m−2 in June. As biomass increased, U. rigida depleted nitrate in the water column. Thallus nitrate reserves also declined from 100 μmol N (g DM)−1 to almost undetectable levels, and total thallus nitrogen declined from 4\% to 2.5\% DM and 1.25\% DM in 1991 and 1992, respectively. During summer, U. rigida decomposition increased, and organic nitrogen concentrations in the water column increased. The uptake experiments demonstrated an inverse relationship between thallus nitrate content and nitrate uptake rates. A modified Michaelis–Menten equation that accounts for thallus nitrate fit the uptake data well. U. rigida can accumulate up to about 400–500 μmol nitrate (g DM)−1 in cellular reserves. U. rigida in the Sacca di Goro has higher Km and lower Vmax/Km ratios for nitrate uptake than other chlorophycean species, indicating a low efficiency of uptake at low nitrate concentrations. This low uptake efficiency, and the ability to exploit N availability by storing cellular nitrate pools in excess of immediate growth needs, may represent a physiological response to an eutrophic environment where nitrate is in large supply for most of the year.},

	abstract = {Extreme flooding due to climate-induced increases in storm frequency and intensity may negatively impact marine species and habitats. These impacts may be particularly severe in nearshore marine systems where freshwater influx and reduced salinity will be most apparent. In March 2021, severe storms associated with an intense La Ni˜na occurred along 450 km of the east Australian coast causing widespread flooding and freshwater incursion into estuaries and nearshore marine systems. These floods were linked to widespread kelp mortality (Ecklonia radiata) in nearshore systems, particularly near and within estuaries. We quantified levels of kelp mortality with distance from the entrance and depth in one of the most impacted estuarine embayments, Port Stephens. Experiments were conducted to confirm that the flood-induced reduction in salinity was the primary cause of the observed mass mortality of kelp sporophytes and to determine the likelihood of recovery from surviving gametophytes. Floods caused a {\textasciitilde}50\% net loss of kelp within the embayment, with almost 100\% mortality at shallow depths ({\textless}4 m) and increased loss with increased distance from the embayment mouth. Experiments verified that reduced salinity, at levels comparable to those during the floods, caused severe reductions in kelp health, photosynthetic yield and tissue strength. Contrastingly, experiments on gametophytes revealed that they were resilient to short-term reduced salinity. This likely facilitated the rapid recovery of kelp that was observed seven months after the floods. Overall, we identified that future increases in climate-induced severe weather and storms events are likely to increasingly impact kelp and the ecosystems they underpin in nearshore systems.},

	abstract = {Studies of photosynthesis and respiration in the sheet-like green macroalgaUlva lactuca L. have typically made use of cut discs or individual thalli. Because this species accumulates in layered mats in the field, its structure has the potential to significantly alter metabolic rates compared to those measured for a single layer. The effect of biomass layering on photosynthesis and respiration inU. lactuca was assessed by incubating stacks of 1, 2, 4, and 8 thalli across a range of surface irradiance and in the dark. The photosynthesis-irradiance curve for a single thallus was hyperbolic in shape with maximum photosynthetic rates of 16–24.5 mg O2 g−1 dry weight h−1, a photosynthetic efficiency of 0.18 mg O2 g−1 dry weight h−1 (μE m−2 s−1)−1, and dark respiration rates of 0.95–1.2 mg O2 g−1 dry weight h−1. Weight-specific photosynthesis and respiration rates decreased as the amount of layering increased, with rates approximately twice as high in a single layer as for 8 layers. A simple model revealed that the reduced photosynthetic rates were due to attenuation of light through the stack. Each layer ofUlva reduced the light available to the next layer by approximately 55\%, and variability in this absorption was directly related to thallus chlorophyll content. Model runs suggested that acclimation of the thalli by changes in chlorophyll content has the potential to reduce some, but not all of the effect of layering. Reduced respiration rates were atributed to the depletion of oxygen from the interstices between the layers. Results were incorporated into a model of anUlva mat, which predicted decreasing rates of weight-specific total mat production with increasing mat thickness as additional layers are added to the bottom of the mat that neither produce nor consume significant amounts of oxygen. The model predicted area-weighted mat production to increase up to a thickness of 10 layers, after which the rate was constant with increasing mat thickness for the same reason. SinceUlva has a tendency to accumulate in layers under natural conditions, these results improve upon metabolic measurements made with single thalli and will be useful for calculations of macroalgal production as well as in ecosystem models in whichUlva is an important primary producer.},

Vegetative blade discs were exposed to temperature and salinity treatments in a 10-day laboratory experiment, and the physiological response was assessed employing photosynthetic (Fv/Fm, ETRmax) as well as biochemical parameters (chlorophyll a, xanthophylls and antioxidant pool size). U. pinnatifida sustained a high photosynthetic quantum yield in most treatments, with a negative synergistic effect on photosynthetic yield observed at 25 °C and low salinities (12, 6 SA). E. radiata died in salinities below 18 SA, except at 5 °C and L. variegata was highly susceptible to elevated temperatures (20, 25 °C). Antioxidant pool size showed species-specific responses to the experimental conditions, being most resilient in U. pinnatifida. Overall, U. pinnatifida displayed broader tolerance to the experimental salinity and temperature conditions than native kelps. The abilities to cope with a wide range in abiotic factors and to thrive in estuarine conditions might contribute to higher competitive strength compared to native kelps leading to its invasion success, especially with regard to ocean warming.},

	abstract = {The Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA) is the first atmospheric regional reanalysis over a large region covering Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia. The production of the reanalysis with approximately 12\&thinsp;km horizontal resolution – BARRA-R – is well underway with completion expected in 2019. This paper describes the numerical weather forecast model, the data assimilation methods, the forcing and observational data used to produce BARRA-R, and analyses results from the 2003–2016 reanalysis. BARRA-R provides a realistic depiction of the meteorology at and near the surface over land as diagnosed by temperature, wind speed, surface pressure, and precipitation. Comparing against the global reanalyses ERA-Interim and MERRA-2, BARRA-R scores lower root mean square errors when evaluated against (point-scale) 2\&thinsp;m temperature, 10\&thinsp;m wind speed, and surface pressure observations. It also shows reduced biases in daily 2\&thinsp;m temperature maximum and minimum at 5\&thinsp;km resolution and a higher frequency of very heavy precipitation days at 5 and 25\&thinsp;km resolution when compared to gridded satellite and gauge analyses. Some issues with BARRA-R are also identified: biases in 10\&thinsp;m wind, lower precipitation than observed over the tropical oceans, and higher precipitation over regions with higher elevations in south Asia and New Zealand. Some of these issues could be improved through dynamical downscaling of BARRA-R fields using convective-scale (\&lt;2\&thinsp;km) models.},

	abstract = {We tested how the availability of carbon and nitrogen determines both the production of Asparagopsis taxiformis (Delile) V. Trevis. and content of the two major halocarbons, bromoform and dibromoacetic acid. The halogenated secondary metabolites of Asparagopsis species are particularly interesting from an applied perspective due to their remarkable antimicrobial activity. Terrestrial ecologists named the relationship between resources and secondary metabolites as the carbon (C)/nutrient balance (CNB) hypothesis. This relationship was tested both in the laboratory, with a factorial analysis using different concentrations of total ammonia (TAN) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and in an integrated aquaculture system where TAN and DIC fluxes of fish effluent were manipulated. The total C/N content of A. taxiformis biomass cultivated in laboratory was highly significantly linearly related to the content of both halocarbons, as predicted by the CNB hypothesis. A. taxiformis cultivated at low levels of carbon and high levels of nitrogen (N) (lowest C/N ratio) had the lowest content in both halogenated metabolites. Increased availability of CO2 in the medium resulted in a general higher halocarbon content in the biomass, even though the effect was only statistically significant for bromoform at high levels of N. The farm experiments supported the results of the laboratory experiments. DIC fluxes had the highest effect on the production of both bromoform and biomass, as shown by multiple regression analysis. In A. taxiformis integrated aquaculture, C, rather than N, is the most important factor affecting the production of biomass and of valuable halocarbon secondary metabolites.},

	abstract = {The generation and evolution of eddies in the ocean are largely due to instabilities that are unpredictable, even on short time-scales. As a result, eddy-resolving ocean reanalyses typically use data assimilation to regularly adjust the model state. In this study, we present results from a second-generation eddy-resolving ocean reanalysis that is shown to match both assimilated and with-held observations more closely than its predecessor; but involves much smaller adjustments to the model state at each assimilation. We compare version 2 and 3 of the Bluelink ReANalysis (BRAN) in the Australian region. Overall, the misfits between the model fields in BRAN3 and observations are 5–28\% smaller than the misfits for BRAN2. Specifically, we show that for BRAN3 (BRAN2) the sea-level, upper ocean temperature, upper-ocean salinity, and near-surface velocity match observations to within 7.7cm (9.7cm), 0.68°C (0.95°C), 0.16psu (0.18psu), and 20.2cm/s (21.3cm/s) respectively. We also show that the increments applied to BRAN3 – the artificial adjustments applied at each assimilation step – are typically 20–50\% smaller than the equivalent adjustments in BRAN2. This leads us to conclude that the performance of BRAN3 is more dynamically consistent than BRAN2, rendering it more suitable for a range of applications, including analysis of ocean variability, extreme events, and process studies.},

	abstract = {Bluelink is Australia’s contribution to the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE). The goals of GODAE include the development and application of eddy-resolving, data assimilating ocean forecast systems. In this paper, we describe several aspects of the Bluelink effort that are motivated by this goal. One of the main innovations of Bluelink is the development of the Bluelink ocean data assimilation system (BODAS). The initial test-bed for BODAS is the Bluelink ReANalysis (BRAN), a multi-year model integration with data assimilation. The Bluelink model is a global ocean general circulation model that is eddy-resolving in the Australian region. Observations that are assimilated into BRAN include satellite altimetry, sea-surface temperature and in situ temperature and salinity data from Argo, XBT, TAO and other sources. BODAS is an ensemble optimal interpolation system that uses an ensemble of intraseasonal anomalies from a free running model to estimate the background error covariances (BECs). The ensemble-based BECs are multivariate and inhomogeneous and are shown to reflect the length-scales, the anisotropy and the covariability of mesoscale oceanic processes. We evaluate the performance of BODAS and BRAN (version 1.5), spanning the period January 2003 to June 2006, by comparing reanalyzed fields to a range of satellite-derived and in situ observations. Specifically, we demonstrate that BRAN realistically reproduces the mesoscale circulation around Australia, representing both the broad-scale circulation and, in many instances, the relatively small-scale mesoscale features. Quantitatively, we show that reanalyzed fields in the region around Australia are typically within 6–12cm of withheld altimetric observations, within 0.5–0.9° of observed sea-surface temperature and within 4–7cm of observed coastal sea-level. Comparisons with Argo profiles and surface drifting buoys show that BRAN fields are within 1° of observed sub-surface temperature, within 0.15psu of observed sub-surface salinity and within 0.2ms−1 of near-surface currents. We identify initialisation as a key area in which the Bluelink system could be improved.},

	abstract = {The results presented in this study provide the first broad-scale regional characterisation of the phytoplankton-nitrogen dynamics across the continental shelf between the Abrolhos Islands and Cape Leeuwin, Western Australia. We demonstrate key features of N-uptake, including nitrate and ammonium uptake and N fixation, across the dominant current systems of the west coast of Australia during a 2-week period in spring–summer. The surface waters of the region were N impoverished with low phytoplankton biomass. Nitrate and ammonium uptake rates were among the lowest on record, and f-ratios were high compared to other oligotrophic systems (f-ratio ∼0.5 throughout), indicating an equal preference for nitrate and ammonium uptake. Areas of high phytoplankton biomass were most likely fuelled by nitrate transported into the euphotic zone during temporally short bursts of upwelling on ∼weekly, rather than monthly time scales. When upwelling had relaxed, phytoplankton productivity was largely maintained by microbial regeneration in the euphotic zone. A large proportion (20–60\%) of the phytoplankton biomass was comprised of picoplankton and nanoplankton cyanobacteria. However, rates of N2 fixation were 2 orders of magnitude lower than dissolved inorganic N uptake, indicating that N2-fixation did not significantly contribute to phytoplankton productivity during the study.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The role of storm events in controlling chlorophyll distribution along the oligotrophic Rottnest continental shelf is examined data collected by autonomous ocean gliders combined with meteorological data. Spatial and temporal distribution of chlorophyll concentrations were obtained from a repeated transect across the shallow continental shelf that revealed complex relationships among wind events (e.g., differences in wind speed and direction) and chlorophyll concentrations. Data indicated that the water column responded rapidly to changes in wind speeds alternating between stratification, de-stratification and vice-versa over 1–3 days. Under low wind conditions (wind speeds \&lt; 7 ms$^{\textrm{–1}}$), the water column was stratified and dense shelf water cascades (DSWC) was the dominant feature. The majority of DSWC events were associated with synchronous increases in chlorophyll and suspended sediment, often close to the seabed. During storm events (wind speeds \&gt; 15 ms$^{\textrm{–1}}$) higher chlorophyll values were present throughout the vertically mixed water column. Maximum chlorophyll concentrations, more than double that due to climatology, were observed 1–3 days after the passage of storms subsequent to sediment re-suspension. Storm events, with an onshore component, promoted downwelling, the water column retained vertical stratification, and DSWC was present across the shelf. Here, DSWC intensified with higher chlorophyll in the cascaded water extending further offshore. It is concluded that wind speed and direction are the dominant parameters controlling the distribution of chlorophyll particularly during storm events.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The effects of major sewage and estuarine discharges on nutrient distributions in central New South Wales (NSW) coastal waters were investigated. The hinterland of the study region includes the sewerage and rainwater catchments of major population centres of Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong. New South Wales discharges the majority of its treated sewage to the ocean, with about 80\% from just three deepwater outfalls off Sydney. These discharges were found to be the principal, continuous, anthropogenic source of nutrients to NSW coastal waters. The deepwater outfalls delivered most of their nitrogen as ammonia and were responsible for nutrient (NH₄-N and PO₄-P) enrichment within usually submerged effluent plumes. Direct observations and modelling indicate that after initial dilution, effluent plumes typically occupy ∼30 m of the water column (60-80 m). Rapid initial dilution was observed with subsequent gradual far field dispersion typically broadening the effluent field to 1-2 kilometres by about 10 kilometres downstream. Flows generally follow isobaths, predominantly to the south. Vertical and seasonal distributions of sewage derived nutrients, were estimated from a 6 year record of initial dilution modelling and effluent data. Comparisons were made with ambient nutrient distributions derived from long term monitoring prior to the commissioning of the outfalls (1990), at the CSIRO Port Hacking Station (5 to 10 kilometres south of the deepwater outfalls). The pycnocline seasonally limited the vertical extent of sewage plumes emitted from the deepwater outfalls. Upwelling/uplifting processes were associated with stratified conditions during spring and summer. Therefore, density stratification was a critical factor in determining the vertical movement of oceanic and sewage derived nutrients into the euphotic zone. Despite clear nutrient enrichment due to sewage discharges, no new evidence has been presented to contradict previous findings that algal blooms are principally driven by oceanic nutrient enrichment. However, by considering simulations of near field effluent plume behaviour in relation to long term ambient nutrient patterns we have identified specific periods of the year and depth intervals with maximum risk of outfall impacts, such as the upper half of the water column during late summer.},
